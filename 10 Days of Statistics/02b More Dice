Objective
In this challenge, we practice calculating probability. 


Task
In a single toss of  fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that the values rolled by each die will be different and the two dice have a sum of .

a. 1 / 9
b. 1 / 6
c. 2 / 3
d. 5 / 6

Solution: The answer is 1/9. The number of ways to get a sum of 6 is 4 ((1,5), (2,4),(4,2),(5,1)). Then we divide that by the number of possible sums we can have (36)
4/36 = 1/9
