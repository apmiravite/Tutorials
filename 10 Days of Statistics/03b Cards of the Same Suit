Objective
In this challenge, we're getting started with combinations and permutations.


Task
You draw 2 cards from a standard 52-card deck without replacing them. What is the probability that both cards are of the same suit?

a. 1 / 156
b. 1 / 39
c. 12 / 39
d. 12 / 51

Solution: The number of ways to select 2 cards out of the 52-card deck is C(52,2). The number of ways of selecting 2 cards of the same suit from the deck of 52 cards is 4*(C(13,2)

[4*(C(13,2))]/C(52,2)= 12/51
