Objective
In this challenge, we practice calculating the probability of a compound event.


Task
There are  urns labeled X, Y, and Z.


Urn X contains 4 red balls and 3 black balls.
Urn Y contains 5 red balls and 4 black balls.
Urn Z contains 4 red balls and 4 black balls.

One ball is drawn from each of the 3 urns. What is the probability that, of the 3 balls drawn, 2 are red and 1 is black?

a. 10 / 63
b. 2 / 7
c. 17 / 42
d. 31 / 126

Solution: The number of ways you can get two red and 1 black ball is 204, broken down as follows:
Case 1: The black ball comes from urn Z (4*5*4 = 80)
Case 2: The black ball comes from urn Y (4*4*4 = 64)
Case 3: The black ball comes from urn Z (3*5*4 = 60)

The number of ways to select 3 balls from each of the urns is 7*8*9 = 504

204/504= 17/42
