Objective
In this challenge, we practice calculating probability.


Task
In a single toss of  fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that their sum will be at most 9.

a. 2 / 3
b. 5 / 6
c. 1 / 4
d. 1 / 6


Solution: The answer is 5/6. We can remove the probability when the sum is 10 (3/36), 11 (2/36), or 12 (1/36) from the universal set.
1-6/36 = 30/36 = 5/6
